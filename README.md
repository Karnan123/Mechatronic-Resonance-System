# Mechatronic Resonance System

This project implements a **Mass-Spring-Damper Resonance Demonstration System** designed to teach engineering students the fundamentals of resonance, oscillations, and applied circuitry. The system integrates **mechanical design, custom electronics, and embedded programming** into a single mechatronic platform.

## Features

- **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi** microcontroller for motor control and sensor interfacing
- **Custom PCB** (designed in EasyEDA) to streamline sensor connections and reduce wiring complexity
- **Motion and proximity sensors** to capture oscillation behavior in real time
- **SolidWorks-designed parts** (3D-printed and machined) for springs, casings, bearings, and mounts
- Fabricated and assembled **40 complete units** (220+ mechanical/electronic parts) for the University of Waterloo **ECE198 â€“ Dynamic Systems Lab**

## Educational Purpose

The system was officially adopted into the **ECE198 curriculum** to provide students with hands-on experience in:

- Resonance and vibration concepts
- Embedded systems programming
- PCB design and soldering
- Mechanical design and prototyping
